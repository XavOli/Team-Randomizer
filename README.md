Application made to shuffle teams either fully randomly or with an equal distribution of sex between teams. Project's aim is for me to practice some basic local storage implementation along with using the webpack starter I created during the Javascript class of Brad Traversy. This is my first project with Javascript that is not part of a course.

Build distribution files : npm run build
Start development server on port 3000 : npm run dev

Dev server compiles (inlcuding tailwind) on save, needs manual page reload in browser to see changes.
