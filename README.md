## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack

### What I learned

Project's aim is for me to practice some basic local storage implementation along with using the webpack starter I created during the Javascript class of Brad Traversy and to which I added the configs for Tailwindcss. This is my first independent project with Javascript that is not part of a course.

### Continued development

Start development server on port 3000 : npm run dev
Build distribution files : npm run build

Dev server compiles (inlcuding tailwind) on save, needs manual page reload in browser to see changes.

I would like to optimize my creation process. After looking at my project, I very likely could have made simpler reusable components if I had to redo the project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Helped me setup Tailwind in the webpack environment
- [Example resource 2](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/1c93938c1fe4f10d1e5b0532ae22e16a) - Also helped me create my starter pack of tailwindcss + webpack
